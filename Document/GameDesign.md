Game High Concept
=================

Theme
-----
    Theme is **Take One, Leave the rest.** 
    So I thought about this theme. 
    So I put this theme into my genre.
    My genre was designed only as a bullet shooting game, 
    and I chose only one bullet shooting game without choosing another genre.

Story
-----
    Snow White left with the prince, and the seven dwarfs who were left behind
    began to go crazy as they missed the princess, and eventually reached a situation where they killed
    each other. Eventually, after dealing with the remaining two dwarfs, Snow White returned to finish the work.

Mock Ups

Prototype
---------

    The Dongbang Project and the 1942 style of the Bullet Shooter Game were first conceived in the prototype.

phase1 pattern
--------------
![Alt text](/asset/prototype/Phase1Pattern.png)

    There will be two bosses in total, and the blue dwarf is the real thing, 
    so we set the heat box only for the blue dwarf.
phase2 pattern
--------------

    The four patterns will be random, 
    and the physical strength will be lower than the one-page boss.
