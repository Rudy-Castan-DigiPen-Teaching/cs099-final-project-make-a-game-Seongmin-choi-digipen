Game High Concept
=================

Theme
-----
    Theme is **Take One, Leave the rest.** 
    So I thought about this theme. 
    So I put this theme into my genre.
    My genre was designed only as a bullet shooting game, 
    and I chose only one bullet shooting game without choosing another genre.

Story
-----
    Snow White left with the prince, and the seven dwarfs who were left behind
    began to go crazy as they missed the princess, and eventually reached a situation where they killed
    each other. Eventually, after dealing with the remaining two dwarfs, Snow White returned to finish the work.
