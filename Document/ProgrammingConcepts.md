7 Classes
=========
To make coding easier, I made various classes. So, I've used several classes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What classes I used.

    1. class Bluedwarf
    2. class blueParticle
    3. class blueParticle1
    4. class Phase2Particle
    5. class Phase2Particle1
    6. class Phase2Particle2
    7. class dwarfPhase2
    8. class Reddwarf
    9. class snowPrincess
    10. class snowParticle
    11. class Title
    12. class Vec2

### The role of each classes.

    -Boss Particle(particle is Bullet curtain) related classes
        class blueParticle
        class blueParticle1
        class Phase2Particle
        class Phase2Particle1
        class Phase2Particle2
        The classes related to boss particles included patterns and Bullet curtain that fit Phase 1 and Phase 2.

    -Player Particle related class
        class snowParticle
        It is not much different from the boss particles described above, but included a laser-like particle that the player fires in a basic shell game.
    
    -Character related classes
        class Bluedwarf
        class dwarfPhase2
        class Reddwarf
        class snowPrincess
        The character-related classes included the character's position, velocity, image arrangement, animation and pattern related to the shoot, and hitbox.

    -Physics related class
        class Vec2
        To express physics to be used in various movements and Boss particle. So, I reuse Vec2 class when I did exercise.

    -Image related class
        class Title
        I just made it to show the title image.
